# AAML2022-Lab2

In this project, Please only update the cfu.v and also add the c/c++ code inside the my_first_cfu.
Before proceeding to the Lab2, please follow the tutorial on the [CFU-playground doc](https://cfu-playground.readthedocs.io/en/latest/step-by-step.html#step-1-make-your-project).


## Directory Structure
Expected directory structure of project directory (`my_first_cfu` as example).
You should always contains `src`, `Makefile`, and `cfu.v`.
And you should test a new environment with your project directory for ensuring your project directory
is correct and decoupled to your original CFU-playground. Because TA will just copy your project directory into the `proj ` directory and synthesizing on to the FPGA.
```shell
.
├── cfu.v
├── Makefile
└── src

1 directory, 2 files
```
